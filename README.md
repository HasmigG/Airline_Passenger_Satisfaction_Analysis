# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction_Analysis
Final Project

Proposal:
We propose to build a predictive model for customer satisfaction of airplane travel by looking at key factors that influence customer satisfaction, such as seat comfort, food quality, and service, using reviews and ratings by customers on their experience. The dataset we will use contains customer reviews from various airlines and includes information on the type of traveler, the route they took, the class of ticket used, and passenger recommendation.

### Outline:
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Recommendations and Final Report

### Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
   
2. Feature Selection: We will identify the key factors that influence customer satisfaction by conducting feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.

3. Model Building: We will train a predictive model using machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods. The model will be trained on historical data to predict the satisfaction level of future passengers.

4. Evaluation: We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also analyze the model's ability to identify the key drivers of customer satisfaction.

5. Recommendations: Based on the insights from the predictive model, we will provide recommendations to Singapore Airlines on how to improve customer satisfaction across different factors.

### Deliverables:
1. Predictive model for forecasting customer satisfaction.
2. Key drivers of customer satisfaction identified.
3. Recommendations for improving customer experience.
4. Presentation of findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

### Conclusion:
By leveraging predictive analytics, airlines can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels and take proactive measures to enhance their services. This project aims to provide Airlines with a predictive model that can forecast customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement, ultimately leading to a better overall passenger experience.

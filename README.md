# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction_Analysis
Final Project

Proposal:
We propose to build a predictive model for customer satisfaction of airplane travel by looking at key factors that influence customer satisfaction, such as seat comfort, food quality, and service, using reviews and ratings by customers on their experience. The dataset we will use contains customer reviews from various airlines and includes information on the type of traveler, the route they took, the class of ticket used, and passenger recommendation.
